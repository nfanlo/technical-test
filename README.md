# technical-test

## Description
This project consists of two parts. 

The first part involves performing the entire EDA/ETL process for the student achievement data in secondary education from two Portuguese schools, followed by the development of classification models and meta-classifiers based on the first period grade (G1). Subsequently, the necessary scripts and files will be developed to deploy the model into production.

#### **Download [Dataset-part1](cs.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance)**

The second part involves the analysis and forecasting of a time series of Germany climate dataset bassed on MAE and MSE. The dataset is available at the following link:

### Dev Instructions:
To clone the repository navigate to the destination folder in the terminal and clone the repository type the following on terminal:

For macOS/Windows:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

Once the repository is cloned install Miniconda on your local machine.

#### **InstallÂ [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html)**

After install Miniconda locally, navigate through the terminal to the cloned repository, execute the yaml file (env.yml) with the following command:

For macOS/Windows:

```
conda env create -f env.yml
```

### Part 1. 

#### Build the Docker Image

Run the following command in the `production` directory to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t prediction-model
```

To start the Docker container once created:

```bash
docker run -v /Users/nfanlo/dev/technical-test/part1/data/test:/app/data/test prediction-model RandomForest /app/data/test/test.csv
```

### Part 2. Analysis and Forecasting (Bicycle demand)

In the `technical-test/part2` directory, you will find:
- The `data` folder, which contains the dataset used for analysis and forecasting
- The `models` folder, which contains the trained models with the best hyperparameter configuration selected during training.
- The 'part2-multivariate-timeseries.ipynb' notebook which contains the analysis of the dataset and the training process of the different models and the corresponding prediction of the one with the best results.
